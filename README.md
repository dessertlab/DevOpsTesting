In this repsitory we present the case studies to assess performance of DevOpRET, a black-box testing approach supporting continuous software reliability testing.

The code in "Discourse case study" folder implements an automated API testing process that provides an assessment of an application's reliability. The tool is currently built to work with [**Discourse**](https://discourse.org/) as an example application, but it can be extended to be used with any other application that offers its functionalities as web APIs.

The code in "Train Ticket case study" folder provide also the Java code to apply the same testing process to other applications.
